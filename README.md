**To solve a quadratic equation using HTML and JavaScript, you can use the following steps:**

1. Create an HTML file and include a text field for the user to input the coefficients of the quadratic equation (a, b, and c). You can also include a button for the user to submit their input.

2. In your JavaScript code, create a function that takes in the values of a, b, and c as arguments.

3. Inside this function, use the quadratic formula to solve for the roots of the equation. The quadratic formula is:

**x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)**

4. Calculate the discriminant by subtracting 4ac from b^2. If the discriminant is less than 0, the equation has no real roots. If the discriminant is equal to 0, the equation has one real root. If the discriminant is greater than 0, the equation has two real roots.

5. If the discriminant is less than or equal to 0, display a message to the user indicating that the equation has no real roots or has only one real root. If the discriminant is greater than 0, display the two roots of the equation to the user.
